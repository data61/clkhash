clkhash: Cryptographic Linkage Key Hashing
==========================================


``clkhash`` is a python implementation of cryptographic linkage key hashing as described by Rainer
Schnell, Tobias Bachteler, and JÃ¶rg Reiher in *A Novel Error-Tolerant Anonymous Linking Code* [Schnell2011]_.

Clkhash is Apache 2.0 licensed, supports Python versions 3.5+, and runs on Windows, OSX and Linux.
Clkhash is part of the Anonlink project for Private Record Linkage from `Data61 <https://data61.csiro.au>`_.

Install ``clkhash`` with pip::

    pip install clkhash


For a command line interface to clkhash see `anonlink-client <https://github.com/data61/anonlink-client>`_.
