Tutorials
=========

The clkhash library can be used via the Python API or the command line tool `clkutil`.

The tutorial `tutorial_api.ipynb` requires `anonlink` which requires a compiler. Thus it is not
guaranteed that the notebook will work on other platform than a 64 bit Linux.
The tutorial `tutorial_cli.ipynb` does not require `anonlink` so should work on any platform.

With linkage schema version 3.0 clkhash introduced different comparison techniques for feature values.
They are described in the tutorial `tutorial_comparisons.ipynb`.
